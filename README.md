# workDeep

## Why

We live in a world of endless distraction with media, social networks, messaging apps all fighting for our time. Time, itself, is our most valuable resource and yet we waste so much of it rather than work on those personal projects which in the long term will fill us with pride.

workDeep was built so that you can track the time you spend on your projects. It has been built based on principles outlined in the book "The 4 disciplines of Execution" and further popularised by the book "Deep Work". The idea is that there are lead indicators and there are lag indicators, and that people tend to focus on lag indicators when they should be focusing on lead indicators. For example, you might set a target of developing 4 apps this year. 

This would be a lag indicator as you would only be able to determine how many apps you built at the end of the year when its too late to do anything about it. Lead indicators happen early in the process so that you can adjust your process. Instead of focusing on the end goal of building apps you can focus on spending a certain number of hours per week in deep concentration developing/building/making and the apps will follow. This allows you to see empirically if you are commiting to your goals. Also it is a well known fact that we play differently when we keep score.
